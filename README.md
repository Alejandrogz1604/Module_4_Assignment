# Module_4_Assignment

The following repository includes my jupyter notebook with the requested dataframes and calculations based on the City Schools data.

At the end of the jupyter notebook, I have included a "Conclusion" section with two observable trends within the dataset.

These observable trends are also included in my written report which has been uploaded to this directory.

NOTE: I was granted an extension on this assignment by T.A Bomin.
